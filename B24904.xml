         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Am not I lesse then the least of Gods mercies? Wherefore hath God trusted me with these things, and not others? Is it not that I might

            </p>
            <p>The ensuing Treatise being commended for successe unto the Lord who inclined me unto it wholly and onely (if I be not a stranger unto my own heart) for his glory and the good of souls, I humbly dedicate unto your and your childrens patronage, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a testification of my thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto you for your free love and favour vouchsafed unto me in your family for these four years past: But also as a Memoriall for you, wherein you may be both put in remembrance of such like
<pb facs="tcp:205883:4"/> principles of truth (and so be kept from errour,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Intus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istens prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet alienum.</note>
) as I have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you at severall Exercises in your Family, and minded of the holy duties requisite unto the practice of piety, that I have often advised you unto, and directed you in; I confesse the whole book is composed after such a manner, and in such a method and phrase (and purposely that it might be sutable for those for whom it is chiefly intended) as is farre below your worth; But will not you more minde the matter then the form of it? I perswade my self you will: And I beseech you to accept of it, (such as it is) and to manifest your acceptance of it, by your carefull perusall and conscionable practice of it, so far forth as it is agreeable to Gods word.</p>
            <p>I would also request two things more of you, First, that you would often pray that you may so partake
<pb facs="tcp:205883:4"/> of temporall blessings, as that you may not lose eternall; <hi>For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi>
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">Omnia si perdas ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam servare memento.</note> What a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly piece of businesse will it prove, to have this life comfortable and eternity miserable? What a sad sight was it for <hi>Dives</hi> to behold the poor begger <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and himself thrust out? It is not usuall with the Lord to bestow two heavens upon his people, one in this life, another in the life to come;
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile est ut caelo &amp; terrae appareas glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosus. <hi>Hier.</hi>
               </note> Secondly, I make it my request unto you that you would often ask your selves what will become of you after this life, and in what eternity you conceive you would be found in if you were to die the very day you make this inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether amongst the blessed or among the cursed? There is a vast
<pb facs="tcp:205883:5"/> difference betwixt the two eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that immediately follow after death; The beleevers eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is one perpetuall day of joy that shall never see night;
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Si Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum habes aeternitatem per Christum in te habes. <hi>Alst.</hi>
               </note> The unbeleevers eternity is one ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting night of torments without day; I would not for any thing in the world that these should be the last words of any of You; <hi>I have suandered out my life in change of pleasures and recreations, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill, nothing, and what I ought not to have done: I have lived unresol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, I die doubtfully, and now unto which of the two eternities art thou going into O my soul? and alas for evermore!</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:205883:5"/> choke that fruit of the word you have begun to bear: But grant that you may go from faith to faith, and that you may so abide in Christ, as that you may bring forth much fruit to Gods glory, your comfort, and the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others; And the good Lord give you and your family seriously to minde the immortality of your souls, and sincerely to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul: And provide for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily while the earth remaineth a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governour and Governesse who may endeavour to know, and to make known the truth as it is in Jesus, who may serve God without fear in holines and righteousnesse all their daies withall their heart and with all their house!</hi> It is his hearts desire and request un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, who is,</p>

                     <p>It behoves you and every Christian, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know and acknowledge the true God,

<note place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note> or to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as an onely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary sufficient Saviour as God makes him willing to embrace Christ; Thus man is to act for his salvation, and to work out his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling (otherwise he that made him will not save him) as he is acted and wrought upon by the Lord; and so Gods work of grace is in us, upon us, by us.

<note place="margin">The occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to give these Directions.</note> I, I say, observing these things, have given you these Directions as a help and furtherance to make you sincere in prayer, and in all other duties to God; For, I would not have you taken off, but directed in duty.

<pb facs="tcp:205883:46"/> I doe not recommend them unto you as formes for you to tie your selves unto, but as exemplary rules for you to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, pray, and perform duty by,
<note place="margin">The scope of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections is, to take peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple off, from formality in duty.</note> that you may be taken off, from formality, and carried on to sincerity in your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon, in your continuance in, and in your finishing of duty. I have not directed you to any thing to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that may limit the spirit, or any way hinder its free workings: For the spirit helpeth not by miracle, but by means,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 6.9. to 14. Rom. 8 26.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I counsell you to make use of these and all other helps, as if you were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pray in your own strength; and to trust and rely upon God for his spirit, as if you used no means at all; And I beseech as many of you as are most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Directions,

<note place="margin">You are to know five divine truths before you can rightly call upon God.</note> before you can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon good grounds to receive any thing from the Lord, that you wait upon him for, in prayer or any other duty;
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 10.14. Heb. 11.6.</note> As first, That there is a God, which is an eternall spirit, and but one in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205883:48"/> yet three in persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; Secondly, That this God made you in <hi>Adam</hi> righteous, after his own Image, and so in a blessed condition. Thirdly, That you sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and so lost the Image of God, and became subject to curse and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Fourthly, That God hath not left you, in that cursed sinfull condition you are fallen into, but hath out of his meer love given Christ to be made a curse,
<note place="margin">The proofs of the six first answers in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme proves these five Truths.</note> to free you from that curse you have deserved, by the breach of the Law. Fifthly, That when God draws you to come to him by his Christ for salvation, with an humble acknowledgement that you have sinned, and it profits you not, and with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to live to him, that then you may, and ought to come boldly to him, through Christ, as to your heavenly Father in Christ with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to receive from him, what you ask of him for Christs sake, that is according to his will,

<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ex. 34.6.7 Neh. 1.5.</note> that you may alwaies act your graces upon him by them, and carry your self towards him suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unto them, in your worshipping of him; Secondly, who, and what you are, that you should have liberty to serve God, to wit, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dust and ashes,
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Gen. 18.27.</note> in your best estate, as you are in your self; Thirdly, what the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God is, namely a tendering up unto God, by Jesus Christ, that honour, homage,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205883:48"/> and respect, that is due from the creature unto the Creatour;
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 1.21, 22, 23, 25.

<note place="margin">Note these things about the worship of God.</note> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, and that in a speciall manner, because honour is immediatly tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto God by Jesus Christ, when these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are rightly performed; Singing of Psalms also is a part of gods worship, in that, praise and glory is thereby immediatly given unto God.
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ps. 115.1. Eph. 5.19, 10</note> And when you perform any of these holy dutyes aright, then you may be said to worship God; yea, when you read the word in private, or meditate upon it, or talk with others about it, or when you instruct others in it, by way of Catechizing, or examination or the like; you worship God so far as you do depend upon him for such grace and mercy for your self or others, through these duties, as these duties, creatures, or ordinances, you have to deal with, are not able of themselves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to you; Furthermore, when you love God, beleeve in him, fear him, rejoyce in him, obey him, or perform any duty to him, or for his sake, unto any of mankind, whether they be meer naturall creatures, or Christians by name, or in deed or in truth: Then you worship God, so far as you honour God in them, and rely upon him for grace, to do or receive some good by these duties that tend unto his glory.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205883:49"/> them; Though all duties be little and weak in themselves, yet they are great and weighty as they are means appointed of God, through and by which we are to receive the choicest mercies, that ever God bestowed upon his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
